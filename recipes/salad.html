    <h1>Salad</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>roccoli salad is a classic summer cookout dish, but the traditional recipe is loaded up with sugar, ample mayo, bacon, and cheese. My recipe is a fresher, healthier version – I nix the sugar, meat, and cheese altogether – and the result is a crisp, refreshing, tangy dish that’ll be the star of your cookouts all summer long!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound broccoli crowns</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons mayo, I like Sir Kensington's or vegan mayo</li>
        <li>1½ tablespoons apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon maple syrup or honey</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, minced</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon sea salt, more to taste</li>
        <li>⅓ cup diced red onions</li>
        <li>⅓ cup dried cranberries</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Chop the broccoli florets into ½-inch pieces and any remaining stems into ¼-inch dice. Peel any woody or course parts from the stem first.</li>
        <li>In the bottom of a large bowl, whisk together the olive oil, mayo, apple cider vinegar, mustard, maple syrup, garlic, and salt. Add the broccoli, onions, and cranberries and toss to coat.</li>
        <li>Place the almonds and pepitas on the baking sheet, toss with the tamari, maple syrup, and smoked paprika and spread into a thin layer. Bake 10 to 14 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes (they’ll get crispier as they sit).</li>
        <li>Toss the almonds and pepitas into the salad, reserving a few to sprinkle on top. Season to taste and serve</li>
    </ol>
